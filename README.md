            s               Really Quiet mode (Do not display hits to console. Speeds up processing when using -o)

            ms              When using -d, maximum file size to process. This option has no effect when using -f
            ro              When true, list the string matched by regex pattern vs string the pattern was found in (This may result in duplicate strings in output. ~ denotes approx. offset)
            off             Show offset to hit after string, followed by the encoding (A=1252, U=Unicode)

            sa              Sort results alphabetically
            sl              Sort results by length

              bstrings.exe -d "C:\Temp" --mask "*.dll"
              bstrings.exe -d "C:\Temp" --ar "[\x20-\x37]"
              bstrings.exe -d "C:\Temp" --cp 10007
              bstrings.exe -d "C:\Temp" --ls test
              bstrings.exe -f "C:\Temp\someOtherFile.txt" --lr cc --sa
              bstrings.exe -f "C:\Temp\someOtherFile.txt" --lr cc --sa -m 15 -x 22
